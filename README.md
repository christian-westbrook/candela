# Candela

When you're busy during the holidays, choosing the next Christmas movie to watch can be hard. Candela puts a fun twist on this decision by creating an Advent calendar of uplifting Christmas films for you to open each day leading up to Christmas.

## Dependencies

Candela temporarily requires Ruby to be installed on your machine. Stay tuned for an update that will allow you to run Candela without installing anything extra or using the command-line.

## Usage

Create a file called `films.txt` and place it in the same directory as `candela.rb`. Each line of `films.txt` should contain the title of a film that you would like to be a part of your calendar. For best results include 24 films in your list. When you're ready to open the first film in your calendar, run Candela with `ruby candela.rb`. Run Candela again each day to open another film to watch. Merry Christmas!
