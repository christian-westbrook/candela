# Use Ruby for development

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a programming language for building a prototype.

## Considered Options

- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby

## Decision Outcome

Although a browser-based solution written in JavaScript would likely be more immediately user-friendly, we chose to roll with a terminal-based solution initially to deliver a functioning prototype as quickly as possible. Between the two considered general-purpose scripting languages Python and Ruby, each ideal candidates for quickly constructing prototype applications, we chose Ruby as a learning opportunity given our greater experience with Python than Ruby.
