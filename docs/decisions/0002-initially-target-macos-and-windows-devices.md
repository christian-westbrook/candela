# Initially target MacOS and Windows devices

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to decide which operating systems to target for initial support because this decision will drive the selection of other frameworks.

## Considered Options
- MacOS
- MacOS and Windows
- MacOS, Windows, and Linux

## Decision Outcome
Initial development is being performed on a Windows machine and our first end-user is working on a Macbook. To keep the project as simple as possible while supporting our development and production environments, we chose to initially support only MacOS and Windows.
