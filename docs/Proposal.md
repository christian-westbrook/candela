# Project Proposal

Problem Statement
---

#### What problem are we solving?
When you're busy with digital work during the holidays, it can be nice to have some form of entertainment going in the background. Planning and selecting that entertainment can be challenging.

#### Why now?
My spouse is currently in the midst of her holiday crunch-time workload and could immediately benefit from a solution. Others are also likely to benefit.

#### Proposed Solution
In the spirit of Christmas, the proposed solution is a digital advent calendar that reveals an uplifting Christmas film to play in the background while you're working.
